// v1.7 · Sol's final presentation corrections, checked on the DRAWING PATH.
//
// The Slice C tests stub the draw functions out and check geometry. That is the
// right test for geometry and the wrong one for presentation: a card can have
// perfect bounds and still paint a trophy over nobody, or quietly drop a
// player's honours when the table is long. So this file lifts the REAL
// drawCard* functions and records every mark they make.
